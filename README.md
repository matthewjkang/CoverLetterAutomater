# CoverLetterAutomater

I have made a python script that creates a cover letter for me after some user input.

This script is tailored for me, but I am sure with some tinkering it could fit your needs too.

If you do want to use it, you are going to need enscript to turn txt files into ps files and ps2pdf to turn ps files into pdfs.
