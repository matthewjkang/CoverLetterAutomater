# CoverLetterAutomater

Lets face it, applying to jobs is a full time job, especially if you are pumping out applications in volume. 
Why not automate the hard stuff and streamline the process? 

I have made a python script that creates a cover letter for me after some user input.
This script is tailored for me, but I am sure with some tinkering it could fit your needs too.

If you do want to use it, you are going to need enscript to turn txt files into ps files and ps2pdf to turn ps files into pdfs. 

If any recruiters stumble upon this, I would hope that you are impressed with my ingenuity and do not take this as a sign of insincerity.
